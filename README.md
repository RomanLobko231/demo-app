# React Study App

This application was built during a React Core Course and includes functionality that is present in most of the front-end projects. For example:
- Hooks, both built in and custom ones
- Routing
- Axios for API consumption
- etc.

<sub>While this project may seem a little bit cumbersome, it sure gave me broad understanding of modern front-end development</sub>
